# Omarchy Grimdark Solarized Theme

Warhammer 40k inspired Solarized Dark theme for Omarchy Linux. This is a grim, low-noise take on Solarized that keeps the palette faithful while pushing the atmosphere toward gothic sci-fi, with custom Waybar, Walker, and SwayOSD styling plus a hand-picked set of free 4k Warhammer 40k wallpapers.

## Notes

- The palette is Solarized Dark at its core, tuned toward grimdark contrast and saturation control for a Warhammer 40k feel.
